# Wrapper around emacsclient that overrides the default server socket location.
#
# The default socket location depends on $TMPDIR. $TMPDIR is subject to
# alteration by Nix. That affects emacsclient, but not the Emacs server. So,
# client and server may assume a different location for the socket.
#
# We work around this by hard-coding the socket location, in both init.el and
# this wrapper.
