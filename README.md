.emacs.d
========

My boring Emacs configuration.

NTEmacs
-------

* Include the following in `~/.emacs`:

    (load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/ntemacs.el"))

Aquamacs
--------

* Include the following in `~/.emacs`:

    (load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))

* Link files in `~/.emacs.d/aquamacs` into `~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs`.
